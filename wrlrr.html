            <p> Wind Riders of the Lost River Range was a team project using SQL for my databases 
                class over the course of my Fall 2022 semester. In this mock situation, our team 
                was given a memo detailing a fictional business and their needs for a new, updated
                 database comapred to their current system. Our team planned and designed the 
                 database from the ground up, including entity relationions, queries, and 
                 stored procedures. <br> <br> This project is still assigned to students at Idaho
                 State, so any finished code from our project is unable to be shared.However,
                 The original project was published by Communications of the Association for 
                 Information Systems in 2005 and is viewable by the public.</p>
